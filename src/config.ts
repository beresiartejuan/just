export const init_markdown = `# Welcome to Your Text Editor

This is a **Text editor** that allows you to create content quickly and easily using a simple syntax. Here are some examples of how you can use the main features of Markdown to format your text.

## Headings

You can create headings using the hash symbol (\`#\`). Here are some examples:

# Heading 1 (one \`#\`)
## Heading 2 (two \`##\`)
### Heading 3 (three \`###\`)

## Text Styles

Markdown allows you to apply **bold**, *italic*, and other styles to your text:

- **Bold**: Surround the text with two asterisks \`**\` or two underscores \`__\`.
- *Italic*: Surround the text with one asterisk \`*\` or one underscore \`_\`.


Example:
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*


## Lists

You can create unordered lists and nested lists easily:

- List item
- Another list item
    - Sub list item
    - Another sub list item

## Blockquotes

To add a blockquote, use the greater than symbol (\`>\`):

> "This is a blockquote. You can use blockquotes to highlight important text or quotes from other sources."

You are now ready to start using Markdown! Try writing your own content and see how easy and useful it is. Happy writing!
